# AidData-Visualization
Visualization with D3.js
## Synopsis
Developed various visualizations such as diverging bar charts etc. to answer the three below questions:
1. Do the countries that donate the most tend to cluster around specific geographical areas of the world?
2. Do the countries that receive the most tend to cluster around specific geographical areas of the world?
3. Are there neighboring countries that have radically different patterns in terms of how much they receive vs. how much they donate?

**Data:**

***AidData.csv*** <br>
Each line in the dataset represents a country and contains the total amount donated and received by the country

***countries.geo.json***<br>
Annotated geo-json geometry file for the world
